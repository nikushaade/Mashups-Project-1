			<h1> Our Creation is Simple, We Just Help Relive Memories</h1>
		<h2> MoviePhy Description: </h2>

		MoviePhy was created for movie lovers who love to relieve their favorite and one of the most famous moments from the movies. MoviePhy is a reminder of all the joy and memories that people have associated with their most-liked movies. MoviePhy is made for all ages, backgrounds and cultures as our Giphy database provides numerous GIFs and "opportunities" to remember what made your favorite movie so special and unforgettable. Don't lose time, dive into the experience and enjoy the genius of Tarantino, Scorsese, Spielberg, Almodovar and many others. 


		<h2> History of MoviePhy </h2>

		MoviePhy started in NYU Abu Dhabi's campus dorm, A6C 502. Me and Fantom were sitting bored in the living room trying to relieve our favorite movie memories, but constantly failing in our search efforts. Suddenly we realized that there was no medium on the internet that would merge our love for GIFs and movies together with simple, minimalistic and at the same time innovative way. In that dorm the idea of MoviePhy was born and today we are proud to share our vision with all the movie lovers around the world.
