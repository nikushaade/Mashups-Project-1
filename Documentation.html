			<h2> Description: </h2>
			For my first project I decided to use two distinct APIs that would involve something that resonates with me and I am passionate about. My first thought was to work on a Sports API, however, I couldn’t find a proper API that would have been interesting to work with. As a result, I switched my idea and decided to focus on movies. After going through numerous movie website APIs (IMDB, Netflix), I settled for the Movie Database API (TMDB), which contains a big collection of movies, tv series and even videos. I decided to match it with Giphy API to make it more fun, but also reminiscent of some of the moments from the movies. There is a search toolbar and after clicking it, whatever Movie Database contains sends the “message” to Giphy and the Giphy platform shows the results in Gifs.

			<h2>Creative and Technical Decisions: </h2> 
			I wanted to make my website appealing, but also very interesting for people who like movies. I decided to use two different backgrounds, as on original background, Gifs don’t look as good as on the other background. Moreover, I added a fictional about page as well as gallery, where I put posters of some of the greatest movies. I wanted to make the experience more than just an interaction between two APIs, that is why I decided to add these additional pages. There are hyperlinks that help you navigate throughout the website. At first I thought I would limit the amount of results that showed up on the screen, however, after giving it some thought I decided to stay with the initial design as it makes for more fun and diverse experience. 

			<h2> Motivation</h2>
			I think the inspiration came to me after I saw the Godfather Gif on my Facebook feed. I realized that I wanted to work with movies and Gifs. This interaction would enable for great and sometimes funny represantation of scenes from the movies. It also helped a lot that both APIs were publicly available and obtaining a key was pretty simple (as opposed to Netflix and IMDB). I wanted the website to look like a movie lovers’ website and I think that movie websites also inspired me in doing this project. 

			<h2> Overall Lesson Learned and Major Challenge: </h2>

			The project really made me realize how hard, time consuming, but at the same time enjoyable coding is. I was struggling with js. folder a lot, however, after a lot of effort and an external (Thank you Craig) help, I managed to make the two APIs work. After the technical part was done, I enjoyed designing the website. I was into full editing mode and was constantly dissatisfied with colors used, background image, text size etc. One other challenge that I faced, which I couldn't really control due to external reasons, was the data contained by each API (it can be controlled, but it need a lot of hard coding). The movie database not only contained movies, but also articles and news about movies and TV Series. As a result, sometimes the movie database API would send a command with "Breaking news: movie XYZ is cancelled" and then Giphy API would return a "Breaking news" Gif. This can be avoided by finding a more narrow and specific API that purely contains movie and TV series data. I think after the project I realized how much each line in the code matters. There would be times were nothing would work and then everything would work, it was a roller coaster experience, but at the end of the day I am really happy with the finished product. 

			<h2> Next Steps</h2>
			For my future projects I want to achieve new heights and do more complex codes and websites. I was very fascinated with one of my classmates projects, who managed to display how many people were watching different movies in present time. I feel like I need to work on my Javascript skills and improve the technical parts of designing a website. In terms of HTML and CSS files I feel more confident in applying my skils and I really excited to learn more and later on apply all of these skills in project 2.

			<h2> Links Used</h2> 
			For my posters and background images I used Pinterest to obtain them. In terms of code, I sometimes refered to w3schools for basic design commands.
